**Girma Game**

This Hangman game project is a classic word guessing game built in Python. Players have to guess the letters of a secret word before they run out of lives. The game provides visual feedback using ASCII art to display the hangman's gallows and the progress of the guessed word.

**Features:**
- Random selection of words from a predefined list.
- Visual representation of the hangman's gallows as ASCII art.
- Feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
- End-game conditions for winning or losing.
- Clearing of the console for improved user experience.
  
**How to Play:**
1. Run the script to start the game.
2. Guess letters to uncover the secret word.
3. Avoid running out of lives by guessing incorrectly.

This project serves as an example of building a simple console-based game in Python and demonstrates the use of ASCII art for visual feedback. Feel free to fork, modify, and improve upon this project!
